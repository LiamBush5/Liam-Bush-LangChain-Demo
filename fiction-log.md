## Adding new files to Datasets

- I cannot append additional data files to existing datasets. If I've already created a dataset, there's no option to add more examples from another CSV or JSONL file. It would be nice to have the same drop down as originally creating a dataset.

## Evaluator Sharing

- Evaluators cannot be shared across projects. It would be helpful if evaluators could be created and shared like prompts across different projects, rather than rebuilding the same evaluator logic for a different project.

## Experiment Creation

When clicking the Experiment button (before entering a specific dataset), only the SDK option is available. It would be useful to have both Playground and SDK options like you do when you click into a dataset and click experiment.
